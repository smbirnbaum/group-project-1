            <div class="textbox">My introduction to music production happened in a living room, watching a friend experiment with a turntable while building his own remix of a popular dance track. What started as curiosity quickly turned into a deep obsession with sound — with how a transition can shift emotion, how a hook can control a room, how timing can either break momentum or elevate it.
            
            <p>I saved up for my own deck and began studying everything I could: beatmatching, phrasing, cross-fading, harmonic mixing, seamless outros, building tension, releasing energy. I wasn't just learning to play tracks — I was learning how to tell a story through them.</p>
            
            <p>That passion led me to the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, where I graduated in 2009 as a trained audio engineer. There, I refined both the creative and technical sides of music — sound design, mixing, mastering, signal flow, and the science behind what makes music hit the way it does.</p>
            
            <p>Since graduating, I've worked professionally with music in multiple capacities, always blending technical precision with instinctive crowd awareness. My background in audio engineering means every set is intentional: clean transitions, balanced sound, dynamic progression, and zero dead air. Every mix has structure. Every build has purpose. Whether it's high-energy club sets, curated lounge atmospheres, weddings, corporate events, or private celebrations, I focus on one thing: reading the energy and elevating it.</p>
            
            <p>If you're looking for a DJ who understands both the art and the science of sound, let's create something unforgettable.</p>
